                                St. Augustine's Choir is a choir that serves in the weekly Mass in the University Parish.
                                The choir is headquartered in Dar es Salaam, due to the fact that a large percentage of its choristers are located at the University of Dar es Salaam.
                                The choir was formed in 1970, with only 17 choristers, the only choir that serves Mass every Sunday at the University of Dar es Salaam.
                                A large group of these choristers are found at the University of Dar es Salaam, the Water Institute, the University of the Land and non-students from various parts of the country.
